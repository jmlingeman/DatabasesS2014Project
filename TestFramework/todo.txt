Indexes we want to build:
    - Index where leaves are the the trajectory that contains a key + the indices of that traj of that key
    - Index where leaves are the locations
    - Index UUID of trajectory is key, points to the trajectory itself

Queries
    - Intersection query

Things we might want to keep track of:
    - Index occupancy
    - Memory usage

Things we want to do:
    - NGram hash indexes?
    - Plot how different parameters effect build graphs
